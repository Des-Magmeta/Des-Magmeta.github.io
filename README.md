## Before its establishment
Well, I started to try to build my personal website a few months ago. But there's no one teaching me how to do that, only to leave some of templates for GitHub Pages. All of development process were done by myself. On Jan 25, 2026, I congradulate myself as my first site was done, running freely. Now it's used so fine if there's no exception.

Considering that some users may use my repos as a reference, I point out some key components here so that everyone can use and edit it to create their own website based on GitHub Pages.
